// ? MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, it uses a flexible, document-oriented data model that stores data in JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). This allows for more flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with large volumes of unstructured data.

// ! Key Features

// ? 1. Schema-less: MongoDB is schema-less, meaning documents (records) in a collection (table) do not need to have the same structure. This allows for easy evolution of the database schema.

// ? 2. Document-oriented Storage: Stores data in the form of BSON documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This makes it easy to map to object-oriented programming languages.

// ? 3. Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding. Sharding distributes data across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance.

// ? 4. High Performance: Designed to handle large volumes of data and high-throughout operations.
