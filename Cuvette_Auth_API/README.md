// ? dotenv is a Node.js package that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Environment variables are used to store configuration data that your application needs to run, such as database connection strings, API keys, or secret keys.

// ! When you call dotenv.config();, it reads the .env file in your project's root directory and loads its contents into process.env. This means you can access these variables in your code using process.env.VARIABLE_NAME.
