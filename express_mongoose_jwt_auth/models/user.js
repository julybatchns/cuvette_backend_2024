// * bcrypt is a password hashing function designed for secure password storage. When you create a new account on a website, your password should not be stored in plain text for security reasons. Instead, the website stores a hashed version of your password using bcrypt.

// ! Hashing: When you create a password, bcrypt converts it into a fixed-length string of characters (called a hash) that doesnâ€™t resemble the original password.

// ! Salting: bcrypt adds a random string of characters (called a salt) to your password before hashing it. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.

// ! Comparison: When you log in, bcrypt hashes the password you enter and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the login is successful.

    type: String,

  },

// Encrypt password before saving the user
